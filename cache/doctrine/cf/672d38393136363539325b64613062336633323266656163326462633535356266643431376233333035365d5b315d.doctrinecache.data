<p>Aware of the growing environmental issues, in a rapidly changing world in which free trade is an economic and social necessity, Iris Estival-David supports several governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental actions aimed at : </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Protecting humanity: Because political and fundamental rights are not acquired in all countries, children and adults are forced into hard labour, charity businesses and prostitution. Many individuals do not have decent living conditions, while companies and young people are leaving by the masses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protecting animals: Within forty years, more than half of vertebrate animal species have disappeared, their habitat is threatened by pollution and deforestation, endangered species are victims of poaching and trafficking. One third of marine species have become extinct.</p>
</li>
<li>Protecting the planet: The destruction of ecosystems and environmental degradation has reduced the quality of living conditions on Earth; by 2025, two thirds of inhabitants will live in territories under water stress. We currently consume the planet’s resources within half a year.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Iris Estival-David : “The degradation of the planet and living conditions is not a fatality. It is still possible, with quick decision-making and concrete actions, to prevent the consequences described by scientists, and construct a new economic and political model in line with the challenges of our time’. </p>
