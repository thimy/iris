Iris Estival David is specialized in: 

* Business Criminal Law 

Legislation is becoming more and more elaborate, commercial exchange has grown to a global scale, the mobility of populations and companies is on the rise, all of this complicates judicial reports. Societies and citizens are subject to sophisticated systems of treaties and laws, of which the lack of knowledge often engenders serious consequences on companies, leaders, and workers. 


* European Law

Approximately a billion individuals in the world are concerned by the legislative acts of the European Commission and Parliament, and by the rulings of the ECJ (the European Court of Justice), and the ECHR (The European Court of Human Rights). In reality, all of the service providers, and the economic players which manufacture, sell, employ or export, in, from, or to the EU are directly subject to this binding and little known legislation. 


* Environmental protection

Because this issue is at the heart of major debates, and since it determines the survival of species and future generations, it has become crucial to take it into account for every step of industrial processes and in human projects.
